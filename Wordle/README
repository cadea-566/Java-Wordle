"Shadow" Data Structure used: 1D list for my guesses
-Unsure what the grading structure asked, in regards to the grading structure, used 1D collection since that is what gave the higher grade.

word list is in "word.txt"

Instructions:

-You can use the On-Screen or Actual Keyboard.
-Letters will lock if they are incorrect.
-Refer to the Pause Menu to see Stats, and buttons to reset the game.
-Guess the Word. Good Luck
-In the case that you win or lose, you must use the reset button to return to the game.

With that said, unsure what else to put on here so,
Hope you have a good Summer!
